Prerequisites TÃ¼bingen
--------------------------------
it is a good idea to use "ssh" e.g.

ssh obelix@baltic.uni-tuebingen.de

will log in to the account named obelix on the node baltic 
which is in the domain uni-tuebingen in Germany (de).
ssh to baltic and (other machines) will only work from within
the campus network.

- Active University ID number to register for VPN with
- VPN client 
- An account on the HPC of your choice if using a server

<x.x.x.x> refers to the univeristy network address

ssh <username>@<remote address>.<x.x.x.x>
ssh -X <username>@<remote address>.<x.x.x.x> (for X11 forwarding)
sftp <username>@<remote address>.<x.x.x.x> (command line file transfer client)
scp <username>@<remote address>.<x.x.x.x>:/path/to/files/file.txt . (copy files using scp)

rsync recommended for bigger file transfers - has options to compress, restart transfer if connection broken etc.
rsync [-options] /path/to/source/ <username>@<remote address>.<x.x.x.x>:/path/to/destination (push/pull files using rsync)
